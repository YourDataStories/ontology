# YourDataStories Ontology
*The ontology that is used to describe YourDataStories datasets.*

The Linked Open Economy (LOE) ontology is developed for the purposes of the EU funded project YourDataStories.eu
The model specification of the Linked Open Economy ontology is based on the relevant data sources and other complementary components (e.g. geographical information, payment standards). 
First, the modelling is initiated by the public projects funded by the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) and the related administrative decisions retrieved by the Greek Transparency Program Initiative (Diavgeia).
